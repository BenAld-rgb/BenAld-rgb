## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**BenAld-rgb/BenAld-rgb** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 2D arcade game
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning game development in Unity and scripting in C#
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on art projects that require a 3D artist.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with programming, SOLID principles and creating modular and efficient code.
